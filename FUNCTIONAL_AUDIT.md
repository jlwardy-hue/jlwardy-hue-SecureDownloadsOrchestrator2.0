## 1. Architectural Design and Major Components

### 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The system follows a **modular, event-driven architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```
File System Events → File Watcher → Unified Pipeline → Security Scanning → Classification → Organization
                                         ↓
                   Configuration Loader ← Logger ← Error Handling ← Quarantine System
```

### 📦 Core Components Analysis

|-----------|------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Main Entry Point** | `orchestrator/main.py` | 129 | 10.08% | ⚠️ Low Coverage | Application orchestration and startup |
| **Unified Pipeline** | `orchestrator/pipeline.py` | 459 | 72.33% | ✅ Good | Core processing logic with security features |
| **File Classification** | `orchestrator/classifier.py` | 45 | 82.22% | ✅ Good | Extension and magic number-based classification |
| **Configuration** | `orchestrator/config_loader.py` | 41 | 82.93% | ✅ Good | YAML configuration with validation |
| **File Monitoring** | `orchestrator/file_watcher.py` | 31 | 38.71% | ⚠️ Low Coverage | Watchdog-based file system monitoring |
