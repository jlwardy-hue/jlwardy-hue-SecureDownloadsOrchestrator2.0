Project Proposal: AI-Enhanced File Management System

Overview:
This document outlines the development of an advanced file management system
that leverages artificial intelligence to automatically classify, organize,
and analyze files based on their content and metadata.

Objectives:
1. Implement intelligent file classification using machine learning
2. Provide automated content summarization capabilities
3. Detect sensitive information in documents
4. Extract and index metadata for enhanced search functionality

Technical Requirements:
- Python 3.8+ runtime environment
- OpenAI API integration for natural language processing
- Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOC, TXT, images)
- Configurable security scanning and quarantine capabilities

Timeline:
Phase 1: Core classification engine (4 weeks)
Phase 2: AI integration and testing (3 weeks)  
Phase 3: Security features and deployment (2 weeks)

Expected Benefits:
- Reduced manual file organization effort by 80%
- Improved document searchability and retrieval
- Enhanced security through automatic sensitive data detection
- Streamlined workflow for content management teams
